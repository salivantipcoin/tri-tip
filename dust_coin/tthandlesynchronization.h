// accepted  transaction  have  three sources  among  them are ,  bitcoin  network,  other  nodes, and  synchronization  process 

// protocol  description 
// INFO  when   hit  other  contradict  info  causes  suspension  of  the  operation   exception  of  that  is  after  ack when  it is  no  turn  back  since  this  point 
//  and  opp is  actepted, there is a issue  of not  responding  nodes  they  should  be  detected  and  somehow  marked  as  not trusted ,  themself  should   know  that  they  are  not  trusted 
// node need  to  have  a  way  to  signalise  that it  is state of overdrive  by  increasing difficulty  thank  this   nodes  even if  they  want  to  behave  badly they  have  to  play it  nice 
// may  be  there  should  be  penalty  per  address  mechanic  to  prevent such bad  behaviour  from  specific  pair,  on  the  other  hand node  may  mark  such   slow  node  as  not  trusted
